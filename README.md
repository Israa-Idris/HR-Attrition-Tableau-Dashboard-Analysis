# HR-Attrition-Tableau-Dashboard-Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing HR employee attrition data to cover patterns and trends in employee turnover. The analysis was performed using SQL for data cleaning and preparation, followed by creating visualizations using Tableau to present the insights.

## Tableau Visualization

Below is the HR Attrition Dashboard visualized using Tableau:

Education with Attrition**: Life Sciences and Medical education fields show higher attrition rates.



 Attrition by Gender**: Females show slightly higher attrition rates than males.


Job Satisfaction**: Employees with lower job satisfaction have higher rates of attrition.

Attrition with Number of Companies Worked**: Employees who have worked at more companies are more likely to leave.


These insights are based on the SQL queries and data cleaning processes I performed using the HR Attrition dataset.
